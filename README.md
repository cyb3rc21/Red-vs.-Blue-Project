# Red-vs.-Blue-Project
A Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both Pentester and SOC Analyst.
As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 
As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during pentesting engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report. 
Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.
